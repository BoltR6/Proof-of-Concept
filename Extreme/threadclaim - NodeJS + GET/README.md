# Automatic Name Claimer
## A program that when run, repetitively checks for unused names that are unique, clean, or interesting and claims them for Ubisoft.
Many usernames are sought after, and I've made a good deal of money doing this.
When somebody changes their username, gets banned, or has their account deleted, it frees up and is claimed by me.
### Features:
- Customizable word list
- Customizable check speed
- Automatic account rotation when timed out
- Easily threadable to drastically efficize claiming
